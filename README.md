1. Lung_Cancer_Prediction
   This file includes detailed data analysis, model training, and comparison on a lung cancer dataset. It likely comprises several sections:
   - **Data Preprocessing:** This section preprocesses the raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Here, various statistical analyses, visualizations, and insights about the lung cancer dataset are presented. It may include histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc., to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
   - **Model Training:** 10 machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, etc., are trained on the preprocessed data.
   - **Model Comparison:** Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves are used to compare the models' performance. This section    helps in identifying the most suitable algorithm for the given dataset.

2. Best Performing Model - Random Forest:
   This file contains the implementation of the best performing model, which is a Random Forest classifier
   - **Model Building:** The Random Forest model is built using scikit-learn in Python 
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance, using techniques like grid search and random search.
   - **Model Evaluation:** The trained Random Forest model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, ensuring its robustness and effectiveness.
   - **Model Serialization:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, it might be serialized and saved for future use or deployment in real-world applications.

3. Deep Learning Models Comparison:
   This file contains the implementation and comparison of three deep learning models: two VGG architectures and an EfficientNet model. 
   Model Architecture: Each deep learning model's architecture, including the specific configurations of VGG and EfficientNet, is described.
   Model Training: The models are trained on the lung cancer dataset using transfer learning and fine-tuning.
   Model Comparison: Performance metrics like accuracy, loss curves, and other domain-specific metrics are used to compare the models' performance. This                 comparison helps determine which architecture is most effective for the given dataset.
   EfficientNet Selection: After thorough evaluation, it's discovered that the EfficientNet model outperforms the VGG architectures in terms of accuracy and other       relevant metrics. This model is identified as the best performer among the deep learning models evaluated.
